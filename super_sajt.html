    <h1 class="nadpis">Silly cat</h1>
    <p class="paragraf"> absolutely love silly cats! There’s something about their quirky, unpredictable behavior that never fails to bring a smile to my face. Whether they’re pouncing on invisible prey, getting stuck in the most random places, or giving you that classic blank stare after knocking something over, they have this magical way of turning ordinary moments into pure joy. Their playful, mischievous energy mixed with those soft purrs and fluffy tails makes them irresistible. I could watch their antics for hours, and each new silly thing they do just makes me love them more!
